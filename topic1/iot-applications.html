      <p id ="iot">IOT Applications:</p>

    <p id="explain">The first part of the activity was on the meaning of IOT applications. 
      Everyone, in the class, brainstormed to come up with different definitions, implementations 
      and features, and presented with their own meaning on the topic. We came to consensus that, 
      firstly, they work on the SENSE-THINK-ACT paradigms. Secondly, these applications are built to be 
      (or are intended to be, in future) self-working to make things easier, so are automated. Lastly, it 
      uses cloud servers, databases and software portals for execution. Some examples are smart-home-security 
      system and so on. </p>
    
      <p id ="iot">Smart Building:</p>
    
    <p id="explain">Similar to the previous one, this section also focused on the meaning of word “smart”. Smart, here, means to increase efficiency and to optimize the output by making the minimal error. We also discussed the features and environment needed to make the “smart building”. Some of the feature deemed necessary are: 
      Various Sensors, platforms on where algorithms operate, Databases, components performing various tasks based on the previous record (or learn if there is none). For instance, auto-alarm system in case of an emergency.
       </p>


    <p id ="iot">IOT Control interfaces: </p>

    
    <p id="explain">This is one of the most interesting part of the module, I found it very helpful as it focuses mainly on the high-level features such as security by surveillance and making reports based on the data so as to better handle the same situation in future. Discussion progressed on how different users interact with it. Users can be students, managers, building staff and so on. Different parts needed for this are sensors, database for storing, cloud servers (programs), and other components which will take actions.
